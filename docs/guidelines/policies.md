# Policies Guidelines

## Purpose

`policies.py` files define authorization logic and access control rules for resources and endpoints in the project.

Policies help ensure that only permitted users or roles can perform specific actions.

Policies are typically implemented as functions or classes that return a boolean value indicating whether access is allowed.

## Structure

- Each app or module may have its own `policies.py` file.
- Policies are typically implemented as functions or classes that encapsulate permission checks.
- Common patterns include:
  - Checking user roles, permissions, or ownership.
  - Validating resource attributes or relationships.

## Usage

- Policies are invoked in route handlers, dependencies, or service layers to enforce access control.
- Use policies to guard sensitive operations such as create, update, delete, or view actions.
- Example usage in a FastAPI dependency:
  ```python
  # ...existing code...
  from .policies import can_edit_resource

  @router.put("/{resource_id}")
  async def update_resource(resource_id: int, user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
      if not can_edit_resource(user, resource_id):
          raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Forbidden")
      # ...existing code...
  ```

## Best Practices

- Policy functions or methods should return a boolean value (`True` for allowed, `False` for denied).
- Keep policy logic isolated from business logic for clarity and maintainability.
- Name policies clearly to reflect their intent (e.g., `can_view_post`, `is_admin`).
- Reuse policies across endpoints to ensure consistent access control.
- Document each policy with its expected inputs and behavior.
- Prefer composable policies for complex rules.

## Examples

```python
# ...existing code...
def can_delete_post(user, post):
    return user.is_admin or post.author_id == user.id

def is_superuser(user):
    return user.role == "superuser"
# ...existing code...
```

## Testing

See [testing.md](testing.md) for comprehensive testing guidelines.

## Updates

- Review and update policies regularly as requirements change.
- Ensure deprecated policies are removed and new ones are documented.
