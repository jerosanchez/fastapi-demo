# Getting Started

## Project Overview

Welcome to the FastAPI Demo project!  

This backend is designed to showcase professional development practices using FastAPI, with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and clarity.

- **Purpose:**  
  The app provides RESTful APIs for posts, users, votes, and authentication, serving as a reference for structuring real-world Python web applications.

- **Architecture:**  
  The codebase follows a **layered architecture** with **vertical feature slicing**:
  - Each feature (e.g., `users`, `posts`, `votes`, `auth`) lives in its own folder.
  - Inside each feature folder, code is organized by layer:
    - `models.py`: ORM/database models
    - `repositories.py`: Data access logic
    - `services.py`: Shared business logic
    - `use_cases.py`: Business logic entry points
    - `routes.py`: API endpoints
    - `schemas.py`: Pydantic models for validation
    - `policies.py`: Authorization/business rules
    - `exceptions.py`: Feature-specific exceptions
    - `composition.py`: Dependency wiring for the feature

- **Documentation:**  
  All specs, guidelines, ADRs, and TODOs are kept in the [`docs/`](./) folder for easy discoverability and versioning.

- **Contribution:**  
  The project encourages contributions and provides clear guidelines for onboarding, code style, and documentation.

- **ADRs:** [`docs/adr/`](adr/) for architecture decision records
- **API Reference:** See the FastAPI autogenerated [OpenAPI documentation](http://localhost:8000/docs) for interactive endpoint details and usage examples.
- **Contribution Guide:** See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute, code style, and pull request process.
- **TODOs & Ideas:** See [`docs/TODO.md`](./TODO.md) for current tasks, improvement ideas, and rationale.
- **Makefile Commands:** See [`Makefile`](../Makefile) for available development commands.
- **Environment Variables:** See [`.env.example`](../.env.example) for configuration options.
- **Specifications:** See [`docs/specs`](./specs) for technical and functional specifications.

## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, you need Python 3 and the venv module for virtual environments.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3.13-venv
```

Docker is required for running the app and its dependencies in containers.

```bash
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo reboot
```

Create a dedicated Docker network for internal communication between containers.

```bash
docker network create internal
```

## Installation

Clone the repository and set up your Python environment.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jerosanchez/fastapi-demo.git
cd fastapi-demo

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
```

---

## Usage

Start the application and load sample data.

```bash
make dev-up
make db-sample-data
```

---

## Development

Lint and format your code to maintain consistency.

```bash
make lint
make format
```

---

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality.

```bash
make test
```
