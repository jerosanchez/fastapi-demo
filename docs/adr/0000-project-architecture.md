# ADR 0000: Project Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are building a system expected to grow in complexity and scale over time, with multiple features and evolving requirements.

The project will require active maintenance, frequent feature additions, and contributions from different developers.

To support long-term maintainability, clear separation of concerns, and ease of onboarding, we need an architecture that enables modularity, testability, and scalability.

## Decision

We adopt a layered architecture with vertical slicing by feature, with each feature (e.g., `auth`, `users`, `votes`) containing its own layers: models, repositories, services, use cases, routes, schemas, and composition.

This approach is based on domain-driven design and aims to keep features independent and maintainable.

## Rationale

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer (models, repositories, services, use cases, routes) has a clear responsibility, reducing coupling and improving maintainability.
- **Feature Independence:** Vertical slicing keeps feature logic as isolated as possible, making it easier to add, modify, or remove features without affecting others.
- **Testability:** Dependencies are injected via abstract base classes (ABCs), enabling easy mocking and focused unit tests.
- **Scalability:** The structure supports growth, allowing new features to be added with minimal friction.
- **Clarity:** Developers can quickly locate all code relevant to a feature, improving onboarding and productivity.
- **Consistency:** Following the same conventions across features reduces cognitive load and errors.

## Consequences

- Some duplication of structure across features.
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries and avoid cross-feature coupling.
- Facilitates modular development, testing, and deployment.
