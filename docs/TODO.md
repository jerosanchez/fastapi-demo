## TO-DOs

### Sanitize post contents before saving or displaying

**Rationale:**  
Unsanitized content can lead to security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS). Sanitizing post contents ensures user safety and data integrity, especially when displaying user-generated content.

### Implement logging across all layers

**Rationale:**  
Logging is essential for monitoring application behavior, diagnosing issues, and auditing actions. Implementing structured logging across all layers will improve maintainability, facilitate debugging, and help with compliance and security reviews.

## Ideas

### Add user reputation system

**Rationale:**  
A user reputation system could help identify trustworthy users and improve the quality of content. It could be based on factors such as the number of upvotes, downvotes, and the quality of content.

### Add content moderation tools

**Rationale:**  
Content moderation tools could help prevent the spread of harmful or inappropriate content. It could be based on factors such as the presence of hate speech, nudity, or violence.

### Add real-time collaboration features

**Rationale:**  
Real-time collaboration features could help users work together more effectively. It could be based on factors such as the ability to edit and comment on content in real-time.

### Refactor monolith into microservices architecture

**Rationale:**  
Migrating to a microservices architecture could improve scalability, fault isolation, and team autonomy. It would allow independent deployment and scaling of features, but also introduces complexity in service communication, deployment, and monitoring.

This idea should be evaluated based on future growth and operational needs.

### Implement a feature flag mechanism

**Rationale:**  
A feature flag system allows enabling or disabling features at runtime without redeploying the application. This improves flexibility for testing, gradual rollouts, and quick rollback of problematic features, enhancing both development agility and operational control.
