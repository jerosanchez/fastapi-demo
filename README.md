## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

We use ADRs to document significant technical and architectural decisions made in the project. 

ADRs help us capture the context, rationale, and consequences of each decision, making it easier for current and future contributors to understand why certain patterns and practices were chosen.

See [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for the full list of ADRs.
