# FastAPI Demo

A simple FastAPI app with users, posts, votes, and basic authentication.

This project is designed to showcase how to build a professional backend using FastAPI, applying fundamental software engineering techniques such as separation of concerns, scalability, maintainability, and comprehensive documentation. It demonstrates best practices in layered architecture, vertical feature slicing, dependency injection, robust testing, and clear API design.

The repository serves as a reference for structuring real-world Python web applications that are easy to extend, test, and collaborate on.

## Features

- RESTful API for posts, users, votes
- JWT authentication
- Docker support
- Sample data loader
- Makefile for common dev tasks

## Getting Started

See [docs/getting_started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for installation and setup instructions.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

We use ADRs to document significant technical and architectural decisions made in the project. 

ADRs help us capture the context, rationale, and consequences of each decision, making it easier for current and future contributors to understand why certain patterns and practices were chosen.

See [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for the full list of ADRs.

## Development Guidelines

See [docs/guidelines/](docs/guidelines/) for coding standards, architectural rules, and best practices for contributing to this project.

## TO-DOs & Improvement Ideas

We keep track of future tasks and improvement ideas in [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md), including rationales to help with prioritization.

## AI Agent Guidelines

For AI agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot), see [docs/guidelines/ai-agent.md](docs/guidelines/ai-agent.md) for instructions and project-specific rules. This ensures all generated code and suggestions follow our conventions and architecture.
